    title: Research Interests
    summary: |
    I aim to develop state-of-the-art machine learning methods for timely and relevant applications, such as the 
classification of vegetation from satellite time series or the detection of marine debris in the oceans. 
    My Ph.D. research focused on deep learning models for satellite time series classification and crop type mapping. 
    Today, I deploy general deep learning models on a global scale which requires tackling distribution shifts with transfer learning on a variety of different applications. 
    In particular, I train deep learning models with the model-agnostic meta-learning algorithm (MAML) to tackle a variety of different problems with few labeled samples.
