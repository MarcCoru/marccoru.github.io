career-profile:
    title: Research Interests
    summary: |
      I investigate and develop machine learning methods for real-world remote sensing problems, such as the [classification of vegetation from satellite time series](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0924271620301647) and or the [detection of marine debris in the oceans](https://www.cell.com/iscience/pdf/S2589-0042(23)02479-3.pdf).
      I am interested domain shifts and transfer learning problems that naturally arise from geographic data. Here, I worked on [meta-learning to adjust models on different geographic areas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13390) or make them applicable on different-but-related remote sensing problems. I also work on early time series classification with [ELECTS](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092427162200332X) and the data-driven encoding of geographic location with [Siren(SH)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06743) and [SatCLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17179).

bio:
    title: Short Bio
    summary: |
      I studied Geodesy and Geoinformation at TU Munich and continued there in a Ph.D. program at the Chair of Remote Sensing Technology that focused on deep time series models for the classification of agricultural fields, i.e., crop type mapping.
      During my Ph.D., could visit the European Space Agency and the University of Oxford as a participant in the Frontier Development Lab in 2018, the Obelix Laboratory in Vannes, and the Lobell Lab in Stanford.
      From 2021 to 2023, I joined the ECEO Lab at EPFL as postdoctoral researcher and became Assistant Professor for Machine Learning and Remote Sensing Wageningen University.
